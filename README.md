**tplrender** is a program that renders a Jinja template, with the attributes given as arguments. The arguments are derived in a way for this to simplify rendering Jinja templates into C source files.

I use it in the build process of C libraries to provide a simple templating system: [Libarray](https://gitorious.org/mcinglis/libarray), [Libmaybe](https://gitorious.org/mcinglis/libmaybe), etc.

tplrender is available at [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/mcinglis/tplrender), and [GitHub](https://github.com/mcinglis/tplrender), and [Gitorious](https://gitorious.org/mcinglis/tplrender).
